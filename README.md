## 🎯 Project Summary  
VisionAR is a real-time artifact-removal pipeline designed for AR passthrough video streams.  
The system reduces noise, artifacts, and temporal inconsistencies using:

- 📍 **Baseline OpenCV filters** (Gaussian + Bilateral)  
- 📍 **Lightweight CNN denoising model** (PyTorch)  
- 📍 **PSNR / SSIM quality evaluation**  
- 📍 **Latency and FPS benchmarking**

The project focuses on **speed**, **clarity**, and **real-time performance**, suitable for future AR headsets and mixed-reality applications.
