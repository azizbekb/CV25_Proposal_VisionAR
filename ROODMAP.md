## 🎯 Project Overview  
**Real-Time Artifact Removal for Passthrough AR (Temporal + Spatial Denoising)**  

VisionAR aims to enhance augmented reality (AR) passthrough video feeds by removing temporal and spatial artifacts in real time.  
Our focus is on **lightweight, low-latency spatio-temporal denoising**, improving **video stability, clarity, and overall visual quality** for AR glasses and mixed-reality headsets.  

---

## 🚀 Objectives  
- Design a **real-time artifact removal pipeline** optimized for AR passthrough video.  
- Implement **temporal smoothing** and **spatial denoising** using efficient deep learning models.  
- Maintain **<30ms latency** to ensure seamless real-time AR performance.

## 🧠 Methodology  
1. **Frame Acquisition:** Capture real-time video from webcam or AR passthrough input.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Normalize frames, stabilize motion, and detect noise/artifacts.  
3. **Denoising Network:** Apply lightweight CNN for spatial denoising + temporal consistency module.  
4. **Rendering:** Output clean frames to the AR display pipeline in real time.
